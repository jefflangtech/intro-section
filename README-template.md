## Overview

This is the first web-dev project undertaken for my portfolio after re-aquainting myself with the basics of modern dev, taking a number of online classes and completing an online bootcamp. This portfolio piece demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JS to create a standard landing page that utilizes drop down menus, a sliding drawer nav in mobile mode, and media queries to provide responsiveness.

### The challenge

Users can:

- View relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile
- Dropdown menus behave differently on mobile and desktop providing a tailored UX depending on device used.
- View optimal layout for a variety of device screen sizes, from 375px to 1440px+ wide.

## My process

### Built with

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```
